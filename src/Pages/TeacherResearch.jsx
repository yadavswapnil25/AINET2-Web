    "AINET Teacher Research Initiative (TRI) is a recurrent activity which supports teachers in conducting classroom-based research in order to address their concerns, sort out their puzzles and work out solutions to their specific problems. Through an open call teachers are invited to join this voluntary initiative, who are then supported throughout the cycle (usually a year) in identifying their concerns, designing exploratory studies, carrying out research into the concerns and trying out 'solutions' based on the outcomes. A team of AINET mentors and peer-mentors from previous cycles helps the participants at every stage of the journey.This is an open initiative and those who are not members of AINET can also join. Announcements appear here, as well as on all AINET social media accounts. AINET members receive personal intimation when a TRI cycle is announced. So far TRI has run through four cycles.";
